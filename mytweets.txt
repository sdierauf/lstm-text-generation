@ScottSmith95 I mean iPads are deffo fun, they just aren't productivity devices, and  are worse than laptops for consumption **IMO**

@ScottSmith95 fosho

@ScottSmith95 if you use an iPad you're usually looking down/at an angle the whole time. A laptop you can stay looking forward.

@ScottSmith95 Hahaha but yes, laptops are better. Think about it. They automatically prop themselves up.

RT @ScottSmith95: @sdierauf Do you find that your laptop works better for content combustion?

@ScottSmith95 Yes I love setting my movies on fire.

@ScottSmith95 Sounds like you want a surface pro 3 :) If only apple would make one.

@ScottSmith95 IMO iPads aren't good at anything, including consuming content. There's no comfortable way to use it still with good posture

@ScottSmith95 Personally, I've owned almost everything in the apple spectrum, and the 15" rmbp is unbeatable. iPads are the least useful.

@ScottSmith95 ...for a while but it was so annoying to edit + save, switch to safari, reload, and make sure everything looked proper 2/2

@ScottSmith95 The main drag for me was the time it takes to switch between apps. When my laptop was kaput I used an iPad as a terminal 1/2

@ScottSmith95 I understand it's possible to do everything you could do on a laptop, but I don't believe you'll ever be more productive.

@ScottSmith95 Sure but would you really rather do that on an iPad vs a laptop with a real keyboard?

@ScottSmith95 I hope 'real work' doesn't get much more involved than 'emailing grandma'

@robdaemon but there's nothing wrong with buying a 4k monitor and then running it at a lower res until the platform matures.

@robdaemon yeahhhh windows 8.1 is better about it but basically everything third party scales terribly (unusably for some stuff)

@robdaemon Meh if you're fine shelling out for one, my friend loves his UP2414Q. Are you going to be using windows|linux|osx?

@robdaemon I used a 28" 4k monitor at my last job, and without scaling I could barely see anything.
